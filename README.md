Î» - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

This respository holds my progress reading through the [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) book. I chose to work through the exercises using [Chez Scheme](https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme).

To run any of the files, first install Chez, then run:

```shell
$ chez --script <file>.scm
# or alternatively you can use the petite chez interpreter
$ petite --sript <file>.scm
```
